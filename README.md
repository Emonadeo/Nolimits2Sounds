# Usage Guide

## Setup

1. **[Download](https://github.com/Emonadeo/Nolimits2Sounds/releases/latest) the latest release and unpack it into your park directory.**

2. **Add the Script to your coaster.**
    > **Note:** It is not needed to change the coaster's operation mode to scripted.

## Assigning Sounds

![Guide](https://i.imgur.com/WRDD4jL.png)

1. **Select the section you want to add a sound to** (Can be a lift, station or block brake)

2. **Open Type Settings** (Or double-click the section directly)

3. **Rename the section to the sound's name** *(See example below)*  
    > **Multiple Sections:** You can't give two sections the same name. If you want to use the same sound on multiple sections, append the name by an underscore (`_`) and a number counting upwards starting from 1.  
    **Roar Sounds**: If you want to add a roar sound, you can name any unused section *(i.e. station, lift or block brake)*. Roar sounds are always played and not limited to that section.

4. **Done**

## Controlling Sounds

Currently a sound keeps playing until the very last car of a train exits the section.
By adding a **trigger** to your track, you can define when a sound should cut off as a train enters the trigger.
Some sounds even play an additional audio clip, e.g. the chain dog detaching from the chain.

![Guide](https://i.imgur.com/LuGlHVQ.png)

1. **Select the _"Add Trigger"_ tool**

2. **Add a trigger to the desired cutoff position**
    > **Note:** The sound ends as soon as the first car enters the trigger.
    Also consider that some sounds play an additional audio clip instead of being cut off immediatly.
    
3. **Name the trigger identical to the corresponding section + `_end`**
